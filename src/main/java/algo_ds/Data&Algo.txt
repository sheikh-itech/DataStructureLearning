Data Structure
--------------
Way of collecting and organizing data to perform operations on these data effectively

Linear: array
Non-Linear: graph, tree
Homogeneous: integer array
Non-Homogeneous: class, struct
Static: array
Dynamic: list

Algorithm
---------
Finite set of instructions/logic, written in order to achieve goal
It can be demonstrated using pseudo-code or flowchart

Input- 0 or more inputs
Output- at-least 1 output
Definiteness- Every step of the algorithm should be clear and well defined
Finiteness- Finite number of steps
Correctness- Every step of the algorithm must generate a correct output

Space Complexity
----------------
Amount of memory space required by the algorithm
Instruction Space:
Data Space:
Environment Space:

Time Complexity
---------------


Types of Asymptotic Notations
-----------------------------
1. Big Theta (Î˜)	=>average time or range
2. Big Oh(O)		=>Worst case
3. Big Omega (â„¦)	=>best case
