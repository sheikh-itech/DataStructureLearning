Old Java Data Structure before java 1.2
---------------------------------------
Vector, Stack, Array, Hashtable

Drawbacks
---------
No common interface
Lack of inter-operability


=>To overcome problems collections introduced in java 2 or 1.2


Collection => Root interface of all collections

List => An ordered collection can contain duplicate [ArrayList, LinkedList]

Set => Unique element collection [HashSet, TreeSet]

Queue => Collection to hold elements prior to process [PriorityQueue, LinkedList when used as queue]

Deque (Dek) => Double-ened queue that allows insertion & deletion from both end [ArrayDeque]

Map => Holds key-value pairs [HashMap, TreeMap]

List Feature
------------
1. Order preservation
2. Index based access
3. Allows duplicate
4. Zeroth index based

ArrayList
---------
Initial capacity: 10

ArrayList Time Complexity
-------------------------
Access By Index: O(1)
Add Element: O(n)->worst case if resizing or specific index addition
Remove Element: O(n) -> worst case if element shift required & removed first element
Iteration: O(n)
